# breathe
simple vr meditation app made in a few hours for a job application.

made in Unity 2019.4.29f1 but should work in anything with a few backwards or forwards fixes.

a meditation app that encourages arm movement and breathing.
-------------

- move hand to selected breathing style. wait for selection
- follow instructions.
- breathe....


help
-----
- bring hands together outside of breathing sphere to restart.
- remove head set and put it back on to recenter.


features
-----
- simple intuitive user experience.
- guided meditation.
- free breathing mode.
- minimalistic clutter free environment.
- audio\visual and haptic encouragement.


inspiration & design choices
-----
- inspired by the apple breathing app on watchOS.
- the bare greyscale environment reacts and shifts to your movement and to the encouraged breathing rythm provided by the minigame. moving and breathing in time to rythm result in less contrasting colors and purer shapes and subconsciously keeps the used breathing in time. this rythm is further encouraged through the use of haptics sent to the controllers.
- a simple timer encourages the user to keep going. (could be expanded with a top 10 score for household competitiveness).
- the look and feel should provide a place for someone to find their breath.
